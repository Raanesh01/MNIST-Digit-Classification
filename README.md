# MNIST-Digit-Classification
This project implements an MNIST Digit Classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.The model is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, and it aims to achieve high accuracy in digit classification.

## Project Overview :

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify these digits.

This project involves:

1) Preprocessing the dataset
2) Building a CNN model
3) Training and evaluating the model
4) Making predictions on unseen data

## Key Features : 

1) CNN Architecture: Custom CNN model designed to learn patterns in handwritten digits.
2) High Accuracy: Achieved significant accuracy in digit classification tasks.
3) Evaluation: Model performance evaluated using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix metrics.

## Results : 

The model achieved an accuracy of 96.85% on the MNIST test set. During training, the accuracy improved with each epoch.
